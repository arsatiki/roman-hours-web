Roman Hour Clock
----------------

Visit http://arsatiki.github.com/roman-hours-web/

This page presents a clock which shows the hours according to the ancient Roman system.
There are 12 hours in a day between sunrise and sunset.
Likewise there are 12 hours in a night between sunset and sunrise.

Obviously the length of the hour changes depending on the time of year.

The software tries to use geolocation API.
If for some reason the geolocation call fails, the clock shows the time in Helsinki.
